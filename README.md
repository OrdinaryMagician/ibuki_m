## UnSX Side Story: Ibuki

---

## Teh Intro

Hey guess what? **Ibuki** is pretty cool, and it would be nice to be able to play as the **Red Oni**. So maybe she deserves a standalone mod of her own, with really cool guns and stuff.

So, while **Demo-chan** was out there blastin' away in the US, **Ibuki** too had her own adventures defending the home front. Many tales would be told by those among the invading demons who were lucky to survive, that a *"naked woman with gigantic breasts"* was slaughtering their forces. They would all get laughed at, of course, what kind of story is that?

---

## Abilities

**Ibuki** is pretty goddamn hardcore. For starters, most things are very likely to not even deal any damage, especially bullets *(although they'll still stagger and cause some perceptible pain)*. Elemental damages don't really hurt directly, but cause certain debuff buildups, which WILL begin to hurt if they get too high. Due to the fact you can't bleed, you're immune to poison, unless it's breathed in.

If your health drops to zero, you will be incapacitated. In this state, you've got two choices: Either wait until you can revive again, or restart from the last save. Reviving comes at a price, however. A temporary debuff that makes you more sensitive to damage. The more times you fall, the harder it'll get, so try not to be reckless.

Your increased bone and muscle density make you unable to float in water. You will sink to the bottom unless you actively keep pushing yourself up *(luckily you can breathe underwater)*. Your bulk and strength allow you to easily shove enemies out of the way as you move, unless they're just too heavy. You can also press a dedicated "push" button to do so on the spot which, unlike the "quick kick", can be used even while firing or reloading weapons. Do note that you need to be standing on a solid surface to use it, as it involves stomping on the floor with all your strength.

As **Saya** often states, you are effectively *"bulletproof"* and therefore you don't really need to wear armor, or clothes, so all you've got on you is some minimal clothing for *"modesty"*: a simple black bikini and jacket, as well as some sandals.

Now, you might be wondering: *"Where would your equipment go?"*. Well, unlike the **Demolitionist**, there is no need for **Ibuki** to use physical Hammerspace devices. Her natural magic bond has allowed her to develop something far more useful and easily accessible: The cleavage gateway *(no, seriously)*. The gap between her breasts is directly connected to a dedicated storage space, allowing her to switch weapons and manage her items by simply pulling them out or shoving them in. A direct mental link lets her keep track of everything in her inventory, and pick exactly what she wants beforehand.

Note: **Ibuki** is 2.2m tall *(7'3" for 'mericans)*, which would generally make it difficult to move around in maps. While normal crouching is already a thing, there's also a special "auto-duck" feature that will allow her to easily fit into spots that are at least 56 map units tall, immediately fixing that issue. This feature is NOT dependent on crouching, so it won't break in maps that disable it.

---

## Weaponry

**Ibuki**'s arsenal is a very personal one, composed of some of her favorites of all time (some of which are a bit too old, maybe, but still "gold").

Most weapons have the usual obvious controls of primary fire to shoot, secondary fire to aim down the sights, and reload to... reload. Any extra actions, performed with the *"utility key"* *(Zoom)* will be mentioned in the weapon entry.

Mag management is entirely hassle-free, as ammunition is autoloaded on-demand within Hammerspace.

### Slot 1 - Unarmed *[Fist]*

*"Sometimes you gotta do things manually."*

Guns of your own making, two of them. Bash in some skulls.

Primary fire punches, hold to punch harder. Secondary fire blocks, increasing damage resistance to frontal attacks.

You can press the utility key to crack your knuckles. This doesn't serve any useful purpose, but it looks cool.

### Slot 2 - Shinigami ZC7 *[Pistol]*

*"Hello my sweet cat nun."*

The ***"Zica Seven"*** is a well-known *"edgy imitation"* of the **Heckler and Mok P7** handgun, made famous by the advertising material **Shinigami Inc.** distributed to promote the weapon, featuring a rather... *"lightly-dressed"* nun with cat ears.

Like its more modest counterpart, it is chambered for **9mm Parabellum**. Some sort of mechanism in the gun appears to imbue the rounds with a potent electric charge. The nature of this process is unknown.

Snugly held with both hands (very snugly, considering **Ibuki**'s size), this weapon has easily manageable recoil, making it quite useful in any situation.

Tapping the utility key spins the gun, just for the sake of coolness.

This weapon can be dual-wielded.

#### 9mm Parabellum *[Clip]*

*"If you seek peace... Prepare for war..."*

Generally found in full 8 round mags.

### Slot 3 - Ninnacht AA12 *[Pistol]*

*"The perfect tool for solving problems in an advanced way."*

**Ibuki**'s most prized possession. She would never go out into the field without it. 12 Gauge, 300 RPM, 32-round drum mag, truly a beauty.

While you'd usually just hold the trigger and let 'er unload, you can also use quick taps to do single shots. Do note that thanks to its cleverly designed gas-operated firing mechanisms, recoil is almost nonexistent, so unload away without fear, you won't miss the target.

A tap of the utility key swaps between available ammo types. Hold the key to kiss the gun. It's a good gun.

#### 12 Gauge *(#1 Buckshot / FRAG-12)* *[Clip, Shells]*

*"Small, but powerful."*

Shells are usually found in handfuls of 4, or in 12 round boxes. **FRAG-12** ammo is generally more rare.

### Slot 4 - HM416 *[Shotgun]*

***"416 IS ALL YOU NEED."***

This specific model is chambered for 6.8 SPC, rather than the usual 5.56mm that one would expect. It is considered a *"priceless jewel"* by some, one they could never part with, or replace with anything else. Truly, it is all they could ever need.

This specific model has been with Ibuki since the early days, and it's been customized to her liking. 16.5" barrel with compensator, collapsible stock, holographic sight and angled foregrip. **Ibuki** had once experimented with giving it an under-barrel grenade launcher but it allegedly *"felt awkward to use"*, and made the weapon too *"pimped up"*.

Tap the utility key to switch between semi-auto and full-auto.

#### 6.8 SPC *[Shells, Shell Box]*

*"Honestly, I don't know what's so special about these."*

Generally found in 30 round mags.

### Slot 5 - Siesta Deliverer *[Super Shotgun]*

*"RIP headphone users..."*

Four barrels of blasting action. Loaded up with custom **16ga Kinylum saltshot** rounds for wonderful cyan-colored death dealing.

Due to the employment of this ammunition, which for 16ga has to be packed quite dense, the receiver had to be replaced with a customized version specially ordered from **Blackmann Arms**. This was definitely worth it in the end. Do note however that this beast makes a hell of a lot of noise, giving away your position easily.

Tap the utility key to switch between single-shot and four-shot modes.

#### 16 Gauge *(Saltshot)* *[Shell Box]*

*"You're all going to be so salty..."*

Saltshot can be found in the same distribution types as the other shells.

### Slot 6 - ANFES "Melisa" Machine Gun *[Chaingun]*

*"I see we are kindred spirits, you and I."*

A true Spanish beauty, popularly known as ***"La Tetuda"** (The One With The Big Tits)*. It's designed to handle **7.62mmMT** rounds, specifically, also of **ANFES** manufacture. **MT** ammunition is well-known for *"setting the air on fire"* as it travels, despite not containing any incendiary material.

Note that the weapon has a tendency to get real hot from extended fire, so give it some time to rest every once in a while, or it'll start to fire on its own. Putting it in hammerspace will make it cool down faster.

#### 7.62×54mmMT *[Bullet Box]*

*"Wait, you're telling me these aren't tracer rounds?"*

Very likely to be found in 100 and 200 round belts.

### Slot 7 - Kemet ST20 *[Rocket Launcher]*

*"If you told me that the Gyrojet would eventually evolve into this, I wouldn't have believed you."*

A man once thought about somehow custom-crafting **20mm tandem HEAT-MP** rounds, and despite all sane logic dictating this to be *very wrong and very not practical*, **he succeeded**. This is the only weapon ever made for that ammunition. Have fun!

The fact that this weapon still exists and ammunition for it is still manufactured shows that there is **SOMEHOW** demand for something like this. The world is a strange place indeed.

Holding the utility key while zoomed allows you to adjust the zoom level by pressing either primary or secondary fire.

#### 20mm Mk.299 Tandem HEAT-MP *[Rockets]*

*"This... This is literally a tiny thermonuclear bomb squeezed into 20 millimeters... How?"*

Usually found as single rounds or in 5 round packs. You're lucky that **Cyrus** knows a guy who knows another guy who can supply you with these on the field.

### Slot 8 - Cryptik "Psyker" Plasma Carbine *[Plasma Rifle]*

*"Ah... Now this is a blast from the past."*

One of humankind's proudest achievements in plasma weaponry. While it's definitely *"old-fashioned"* compared to the more modern solutions of **Nukuri** and **Xekkian** manufacture, it is sufficiently effective by human standards, having even survived the test of time through several revisions since its first introduction in the mid-2030s.

Look, **Ibuki** just loves guns that have *"aged like a fine wine"*, and this is one of them. One would probably also say she likes it because it's all black and red, her two favorite colors.

Unlike most other plasma weapons of modern times, the Psyker doesn't need to let others know it's a plasma weapon by constantly emitting light.

#### Plasma Cell *[Cells]*

*"Nice and simple, how things used to be before they started putting all those random fancy lights on them."*

Plasma ammunition is generally found in **NATO** standard 60x72mm compressed argon cells. Each of these allows for 30 shots of the **Psyker**. Note that your autoloader has support for consolidating plasma charges too, so partial reloads won't be as wasteful.

### Slot 9 - Cyrus "Quaker" Portable Cannon *[BFG 9000]*

*"This one's kinda hard to pull out of my cleavage, but it's worth it."*

Portable **120mm** artillery? It's all possible thanks to **Cyrus Enterprises**. Just be sure to have enough room in your **Hammerspace** to store up plenty of rounds to blast 'em all to bits, they'll get auto-loaded as needed.

Tapping the utility key will cycle between available ammo types.

#### 120mm "Redeemer" Warhead *[Cell Pack]*

*"Adios, motherfucker..."*

They're fairly hefty and stick out like a sore thumb. Still, they're somewhat rare to find. Redeemers have a fairly wide blast radius, cooking everything within range in less than a second.

#### 120mm "Mad Dog" Canister Shot *[Cell Pack]*

*"Now these are the kinds of balls I like to play with..."*

These are also fairly rare, and offer much more chaotic results than the standard warheads, dispersing a barrage of cluster grenades everywhere.

#### 120mm "Caster" Plasma Charge *[Cell Pack]*

*"Holy fucking shit..."*

Surprisingly more common than the other two. These things laugh in the face of the **UAC**'s prized **Botis Field Glyph**, employing far more efficient **Nokorokinylum** *(banned in all **White Scar** signatory countries)*. Each shot ejects high-pressure jets of incandescent liquid **Nokorokinylum** fuel, which bursts into searing clouds of **Nokron** and **Kinylum** plasma on impact.

### Slot 0 - Areka "Boar Slayer" 50mm *[Chainsaw]*

*"Got this one as a gift from a nice Xekkian girl. Oh, I still remember that night..."*

The **Boar Slayer** is clearly not meant for human use, but that's definitely not going to stop you now, is it?

Ammo for this puppy is quite rare, however, but that's compensated by how devastating even a single shot can be.

#### 50mm Areka *[Rockets]*

*"... I wonder if... With that size..."*

Available in 5 round mags or single rounds. These things are big.

## Items

Gotta have some of these too to help in your adventure. **Ibuki** will happily hoard what she doesn't need to use right away.

### Water Bottle *[Health Bonus, Stimpack, Medikit]*

*"I know a sizable number of people who should drink more of this, because they sure are thirsty..."*

Staying hydrated is important. Available in three sizes, recovering 5 HP, 20 HP and 50 HP each.

### Spiritual Stimulant *[Soulsphere, Megasphere]*

*"Ohhhhh... That feels good..."*

A potent overheal of 100 HP with no upper cap whatsoever. Note that any healing above 100 will wear off over time, faster the higher it's at. Megaspheres are replaced by two of them, for a 200 HP boost.

### Oil Bottle *[Armor Bonus, Green Armor, Blue Armor]*

*"Time to oil up..."*

Increases your damage resistance, somehow *(something about **Ibuki**'s skin)*. The more you rub on, the better. Note that going for a swim will cause you to rapidly lose this protection.

### Hammerspace Embiggener *[Backpack]*

*"Heh... Nerd..."*

Lets you carry more ammo. Your plan allows for up to 8 expansions. In addition, each redeemed card comes with a free delivery of ammo for most of your weapons.

### LiSA Room Tearing Device *[Blursphere]*

*"Saya keeps laughing at the name of this thing. I don't really get it."*

A very potent timed explosive. Make sure to take cover, because it hits hard. Used through a dedicated keybind, rather than the inventory bar.

### Bootleg "Mischievous Ellen" Vodka *[Berserk]*

*"Bottoms up!"*

This will bring you back to full health and give you a fairly decent strength boost *(Enough to tear enemies apart with your bare hands)*. Do note however that **Ibuki**'s body metabolizes the drunkedness away quickly. Part of **Ellen**'s seemingly unending stash.

### Omnisight *[Computer Map]*

*"Good thing I brought along my tablet, or I'd get lost in this dump."*

Fills out the data for your automap, basically.

### Red Oni Milk Jug *[Invulnerability]*

*"I taste so delicious~"*

This thing can get you so pumped up you pretty much become unstoppable after chugging it. Talk about getting high off your own supply...

### Glow Visor *[Lite-Amp]*

*"Pretty sure this is the same model Ellen-san uses."*

Cheap and easy night vision goggles. Can be toggled if you wanna save that battery.

### Elemental Coating *[Radsuit]*

*"Sometimes you gotta wear protection..."*

The usual solution for getting into dangerous terrain. Just pop it and go for a dive.

### Aerial Amulet *[Wings of Wrath]*

*"It's surprising that this thing can even lift me off the ground."*

A convenient little magic artifact that allows you to float in mid-air. Far more comfortable than the **Gravity Suppressor**, but unlike that one, this has a weight limit *(poor **Demo-chan**, their shiny metal butt is just too damn heavy)*. Its effects can be conveniently toggled at will, allowing you to save up energy when needed.

### Safety Tether *[Chaos Device]*

*"I'm outta here, bitches."*

Allows you to make a quick escape back to the start of the map when activated. Also releases some damaging shockwaves on both endpoints in the process. Useful when you're trapped in some inescapable room, or get surrounded by an overwhelming amount of enemies.

## Bonus Features

Some extras that are entirely optional, but add to the experience.

### NIN Radio

*"I could listen to these all day."*

A playlist of several instrumental **Nine Inch Nails** tracks, ready to be popped into your trusty music player. Tracks are automatically shuffled and will play one after another, rather than looping per-map.

### Mischievous Ellen

*"That's my gal pal right there."*

You can bring along an old friend to these adventures. The undying drunkard gremlin that married **Saya**'s brother right by your side. Share some of your vodka with her to make her get even more pumped up for combat. She carries two weapons, which she'll alternate between as needed. A beefy .50 PE **Beagle** sidearm and her mainstay 4mm **Hyperion** gauss rifle, loaded with shock charge tipped bolts for extra knockback.

As expected of an **Anarukon**, she will get back up after a while when she gets killed, so you don't have to worry about losing her. If she ever loses track of you somehow, she can easily employ the trusty magic skills of her **Yanikov** blood to warp to your position.

You can share healing and powerups with her *(Yes, this includes the milk)*.

---

## DLC

Post-release I could attempt to add some extra weapons to expand this arsenal, perhaps some other personal favorites.

### Slot 1 - The Purifier *[Chainsaw]*

*"Ah, the American pastime..."*

A slab of pure almasteel molded into the shape of a simple baseball bat. It's said that this thing is capable of *"literally beating the soul out of people"*. **Saya** allegedly asked **Misa** to make this because it would allow you to *"exorcise evil spirits"* with it.

Primary fire swings in front of you, can be held to charge up a wider swing. Secondary fire blocks, it's generally very effective due to the materials used *(can even deflect bullets if you hold it just right)*.

Pressing the utility key throws a ball in front of you, which can be struck with the bat for ranged attacks. An endless supply of balls is provided through Hammerspace. This action can still be performed while holding primary fire.

### Slot 4 - Ninnacht .50 PE Brave Beagle *[Shotgun]*

*"Oh, this doggy really does bite."*

A beefy handcannon of the olden days, made quite popular thanks to it being featured in practically every action movie and shooter game. It has resisted the test of time, and even some **UAC** marines are known to carry them. The official full naming of the caliber, devised by **Blackmann Arms**, cannot be disclosed without prompting chuckles from **Saya**.

It would seemingly kick like a mule, but Ibuki doesn't have much trouble with that, unlike her smaller companion. Has a propensity to turn squishy targets into meatloaf.

Like your usual sidearm, you can also give it a spin with the utility key. However, it can't be dual-wielded.

#### .50 PE *[Shells]*

*"\*snicker\* Wait, it actually means THAT?"*

Found in 7 round mags.

### Slot 5 - Garrett MK.77 "Survivor" *[Super Shotgun]*

*"There WAS a hell knight..."*

Having miraculously come out unscathed from the **White Scar**, the **Garrett Gunners Group** celebrated with the creation of this .50 OMG over-under hunting rifle, popular among wastelanders at the time, and more popular nowadays among survivors of the demonic invasion of 2148, for its ability to *"erase"* beastly Hell nobles.

Holding the utility key will switch to two-shot mode, for when you truly want something erased.

#### .50 Oh My God *[Shell Box]*

*"I don't think these really are that OMG-worthy, I've seen bigger."*

Found as either spare rounds or 20 round packs.

### Slot 6 - Shinigami MM95 *[Chaingun]*

*"Well, I do like me some penetration once in a while."*

The ***"Masamune 95"*** was the very first battle rifle devised by **Shinigami Inc.**, meant to compete with popular western battle rifles at the time, such as the **HM417**. As per usual convention it is chambered for 7.62×51mm, although conversion kits exist for lower AND higher calibers. It is additionally equipped with a holographic sight for improved sighted accuracy. Bullets are enchanted for extra penetration, allowing them to cleave cleanly through everything, including some walls.

The utility key alternates between semi auto, three round burst and full auto.

#### 7.62×51mm NATO *[Bullet Box]*

*"Real... Fuckin'... NATO."*

Very standard stuff. Found in 30-round mags.

### Slot 7 - Itamex "Rita" Micro-Missile Launcher *[Rocket Launcher]*

*"Good things come in small packages... LOTS of exploding small packages."*

Nicknamed the ***"Eightball"*** by enthusiasts *(especially of the nerdy kind, who in addition don't realize what that name actually referred to)*, the **Rita** is a force to be reckoned with. Eight revolving barrels, for up to eight simultaneous micro-missile launches. Ammunition is fed from a 24-round internal magazine, allowing for the user to dispense three full barrages of projectiles before needing to reload.

While aiming through the visor, you will mark whatever target you've got on your sights to lock on for homing missiles.

The utility key loads the barrels, up to eight in total. All will be fired simultaneously in a tight wad upon pressing the fire button. Note that if you didn't preload and press the fire button, it will load just one missile beforehand.

#### 20×30mm Micro-Missile *[Rockets]*

*"It's not the size that matters..."*

Found as either spare rounds or 8-round packs.

### Slot 8 - Cyrus Stormbringer *[Plasma Rifle]*

*"Electricity isn't scary... But it's gonna be for you."*

The very power of lightning at your fingertips. Unleashing potent arcs of high voltage death, the **Stormbringer** can melt through anything you aim it at, and cook raw poultry in a matter of milliseconds *(delicious)*.

Don't even think about using this underwater, although it is a very good strategy to aim for it as long as it's the enemy that's touching the stuff and not you.

A tap of the utility key will toggle a focused mode which keeps the arcs from spreading too much, allowing them to focus entirely on one target at a time, for maximum cooking potential.

#### Dysedum Rod *[Cells]*

*"We trust the rod... Or whatever it was that Sayacchi said."*

You'll find these either all alone or in small handfuls. The Stormbringer takes seven of them.

---

## Compatibility

**Doom** is pretty much the baseline here. **Heretic** support will be added later on but it won't be a high priority. In regards to **Hexen** I don't think it'd fit much both gameplay and story-wise. It's very likely that it'll remain solely **Doom** and **Heretic** compatible and nothing more. As there's not much id-specific here like there was with **SWWM GZ**, it could also work with **Freedoom**, I suppose.

Note: Playing through vanilla maps with this would be considered a storyline discrepancy, but I'm not gonna stop you.

Also Note: This would have potential with **H-Doom**, like, genuinely. **Ibuki** would totally be up for some demon pussy slaying, but I'm not even sure how that would work considering they're sprites and the player is 3D modeled.

---

*"I'm just here to have fun, and you bastards are here to provide that fun."*
