## UnSX Side Story: Ibuki

---

## Teh Intro

Hey guess what? **Ibuki** is pretty cool, and it would be nice to be able to play as the **Red Oni**. So maybe she deserves a standalone mod of her own, with really cool guns and stuff.

This will be made some day, I promise. For now, I'm just noting down the plans here.

---

## Abilities

**Ibuki** is pretty goddamn hardcore, sporting a hefty 1000-point health pool and built-in resistances to many things. For starters, most things are very likely to not even deal any damage, especially bullets *(although they'll still stagger and cause some perceptible pain)*. Elemental damages don't really hurt directly, but cause certain debuff buildups, which WILL begin to hurt if they get too high. Due to the fact you can't bleed, you're immune to poison, unless it's breathed in.

If your health drops to zero, you will be incapacitated. In this state, you've got two choices: Either wait until you can revive again, or restart from the last save. Reviving comes at a price, however. A temporary debuff that makes you more sensitive to damage. The more times you fall, the harder it'll get, so try not to be reckless.

Your increased bone and muscle density make you unable to swim. You will sink to the bottom unless you actively keep pushing yourself up *(luckily you can breathe underwater)*. Your bulk and strength allow you to easily shove enemies out of the way as you move, unless they're just too heavy. You can also press a dedicated "push" button to do so on the spot.

You're equipped with a **Forx® JetBurst™ Impulsor**, allowing you to pretty much fly wherever you want by pressing a dedicated button. A second press will disengage the jetpack. Fuel is limited, but it regenerates when not in use.

Note: **Ibuki** is 2.2m tall *(7'3" for 'mericans)*, which would generally make it difficult to move around in maps. While normal crouching is already a thing, there's also a special "auto-duck" feature that will allow her to easily fit into spots that are at least 56 map units tall, immediately fixing that issue. This feature is NOT dependent on crouching, so it won't break in maps that disable it.

## Weaponry

**Ibuki**'s arsenal is a very personal one, composed of some of her favorites of all time (some of which are a bit too old, maybe, but still "gold").

Most weapons have the usual obvious controls of primary fire to shoot, secondary fire to aim down the sights, and reload to... reload. Any extra actions, performed with the *"utility key"* *(Zoom)* will be mentioned in the weapon entry.

Mag management is entirely hassle-free, as ammunition is autoloaded on-demand within Hammerspace.

### Slot 1 - Unarmed *[Fist]*

Guns of your own making, two of them. Bash in some skulls.

Primary fire punches, hold to punch harder. Secondary fire blocks, increasing damage resistance to frontal attacks.

You can press the utility key to crack your knuckles. This doesn't serve any useful purpose, but it looks cool.

### Slot 2 - Shinigami ZC7 *[Pistol]*

A well-known *"edgy imitation"* of the **Heckler and Mok P7** handgun. Made famous by the advertising material **Shinigami Inc.** distributed to promote the weapon, featuring a rather... *"lightly-dressed"* nun with cat ears.

Like its more modest counterpart, it is chambered for **9mm Parabellum**. Some sort of mechanism in the gun appears to imbue the rounds with a potent electric charge. The nature of this process is unknown.

The utility key spins the gun, for coolness factor.

### Slot 3 - Ninnacht AA12 *[Pistol]*

**Ibuki**'s most prized possession. She would never go out into the field without it. 12 Gauge, 300 RPM, 32-round drum mag, truly a beauty.

Tap the utility key swaps between available ammo types.

### Slot 4 - HM416 *[Shotgun]*

***"416 IS ALL YOU NEED"***

This specific model is chambered for 6.8 SPC, rather than the usual 5.56mm that one would expect. It is considered a *"priceless jewel"* by some, one they could never part with, or replace with anything else. Truly, it is all they could ever need.

Tap the utility key to switch between semi-auto and full-auto.

### Slot 5 - Siesta Deliverer *[Super Shotgun]*

Four barrels of blasting action. Loaded up with custom **16ga Kinylum saltshot** rounds for wonderful cyan-colored death dealing.

Tap the utility key to switch between single-shot and four-shot modes.

### Slot 6 - ANFES "Melisa" Machine Gun *[Chaingun]*

A true Spanish beauty, popularly known as ***"La Tetuda"** (The One With The Big Tits)*. It's designed to handle **7.62mmMT** rounds, specifically, also of **ANFES** manufacture. **MT** ammunition is well-known for *"setting the air on fire"* as it travels, despite not containing any incendiary material.

### Slot 7 - Kemet ST20 *[Rocket Launcher]*

A man once thought about somehow custom-crafting **20mm tandem HEAT-MP** rounds, and despite all sane logic dictating this to be *very wrong and very not practical*, **he succeeded**. This is the only weapon ever made for that ammunition. Have fun!

The fact that this weapon still exists and ammunition for it is still manufactured shows that there is **SOMEHOW** demand for something like this. The world is a strange place indeed.

### Slot 8 - Cryptik "Psyker" Plasma Carbine *[Plasma Rifle]*

One of humankind's proudest achievements in plasma weaponry. While it's definitely *"old-fashioned"* compared to the more modern solutions of **Nukuri** and **Xekkian** manufacture, it is sufficiently effective by human standards, having even survived the test of time through several revisions since its first introduction in the mid-2030s.

Look, **Ibuki** just loves guns that have *"aged like a fine wine"*, and this is one of them.

### Slot 9 - Cyrus "Quaker" Portable Cannon *[BFG 9000]*

Portable **120mm** artillery? It's all possible thanks to **Cyrus Enterprises**. Just be sure to have enough room in your **Hammerspace** to store up plenty of rounds to blast 'em all to bits, they'll get auto-loaded as needed.

### Slot 0 - Areka "Boar Slayer" 50mm *[Chainsaw]*

The **Boar Slayer** is clearly not meant for human use, but that's definitely not going to stop you now, is it?

Ammo for this puppy is quite rare, however, but that's compensated by how devastating even a single shot can be.

## Ammo

All the goodies you can find scattered 'round. Delivery, as usual, courtesy of **Cyrus Enterprises**.

### 9mm Parabellum

Generally found in full 7 round mags.

### 12 Gauge *(#1 Buckshot / FRAG-12)*

Shells are usually found in handfuls of 4, or in 12 round boxes. **FRAG-12** ammo is generally more rare.

### 6.8 SPC

Generally found in 30 round mags.

### 16 Gauge *(Saltshot)*

Saltshot can be found in the same distribution types as the other shells.

### 7.62mmMT

Very likely to be found in 100 and 200 round belts.

### 20mm Mk.299 Tandem HEAT-MP

Usually found as single rounds or in 5 round packs. You're lucky that **Cyrus** knows a guy who knows another guy who can supply you with these on the field.

### Plasma Cell

Plasma ammunition is generally found in **NATO** standard 30x36mm compressed argon cells. Each of these allows for 20 shots of the **Psyker**.

### 120mm "Quaker" Warhead

They're fairly hefty and stick out like a sore thumb. Still, they're somewhat rare to find.

### 50mm Areka

Available in 5 round mags or single rounds. These things are big.

## Items

Gotta have some of these too to help in your adventure.

### Water Bottle *[Health Bonus, Stimpack, Medikit]*

Staying hydrated is important. Available in three sizes, recovering 10 HP, 50 HP and 100 HP each.

### Spiritual Stimulant *[Soulsphere, Megasphere]*

A potent overheal of 1000HP. Note that any healing above 1000 will wear off over time.

### Oil Bottle *[Armor Bonus, Green Armor, Blue Armor]*

Increases your damage resistance, somehow *(something about **Ibuki**'s skin)*. The more you oil up, the better.

### Hammerspace Embiggener *[Backpack]*

Lets you carry more ammo. Your plan allows for up to 8 expansions. In addition, each redeemed card comes with a free delivery of ammo for most of your weapons.

### LiSA Anti-Barricade Device *[Blursphere]*

An explosive device that can tear apart many obstacles.

### Bootleg "Mischievous Ellen" Vodka *[Berserk]*

This will overheal for 250 HP and give you a fairly decent strength boost. Do note however that **Ibuki**'s body metabolizes the drunkedness away quickly. Part of **Ellen**'s seemingly unending stash.

### Area Map *[Computer Map]*

Fills out the data for your automap, basically.

### Red Oni Milk Jug *[Invulnerability]*

This thing can get you so pumped up you pretty much become unstoppable after chugging it. Talk about getting high off your own supply...

### Glow Visor *[Lite-Amp]*

Cheap and easy night vision goggles. Can be toggled if you wanna save that battery.

### Elemental Coating *[Radsuit]*

The usual solution for getting into dangerous terrain. Just pop it and go for a dive.

---

## Bonus Features

Some extras that are entirely optional, but add to the experience.

### NIN Radio

A playlist of several instrumental **Nine Inch Nails** tracks, ready to be popped into your trusty music player. Tracks are automatically shuffled and will play one after another, rather than looping per-map.

### Mischievous Ellen

You can bring along an old friend to these adventures. The undying drunkard gremlin that married **Saya**'s brother right by your side. Share some of your vodka with her to make her get even more pumped up for combat. She carries two weapons, which she'll alternate between as needed. A beefy .50 AE **Eris** sidearm and her mainstay 4mm **Hyperion** gauss rifle, loaded with shock charge tipped bolts for extra knockback.

As expected of an **Anarukon**, she will get back up after a while when she gets killed, so you don't have to worry about losing her.

### Nudist Mode

Removes your exoskeleton, jetpack and the minimal clothing **Ibuki** begrudgingly wears to not *"titillate"* people too much in public. All that's left is a belt to hold your Hammerspace devices and the very important **Lucky Collar** that **Saya** gave you. Do note that the added *"looseness"* will increase your view bob as you run, and for obvious reasons you'll lose the ability to fly.

Note: This doesn't affect the **Mischievous Ellen** follower. She's more than used to seeing **Ibuki** naked.
